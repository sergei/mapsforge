/**
 * The mapsforge-map library allows applications to render and display a map without Internet connection. It can
 * be used on all Android devices running version 1.6 or higher. An application needs to extend the
 * {@link org.mapsforge.android.maps.MapActivity} class in order to use a
 * {@link org.mapsforge.android.maps.MapView}. More than one MapView instance may be used simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * The most important classes and methods from the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/"
 * target="_top">Google APIs Add-On</a> are implemented. However, no API key is required and no abstract methods
 * must be overridden.
